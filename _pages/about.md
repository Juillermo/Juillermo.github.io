I am an interdisciplinary researcher within the fields of the **Computational Social Sciences** from the perspectives of **Complex Systems, Network Science, Statistical Physics, Agent--Based Simulations, and Artificial Intelligence**.
My main focus of research is the study of how external influence can affect the dynamics of opinions within a social group, its social norms, or producing other phenomena such as consensus or opinion fragmentation.
While my PhD research focused on theoretical and computationally heavy approaches, my current aim is to further integrate my expertise with that of researchers from the applied sciences to increase the significance and impact of the research.

I have published peer--reviewed articles on various topics, including opinion dynamics, party competition, multimorbidity, swarm sensing, voting advice applications, and the interpretability of black-box models.
